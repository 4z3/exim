# TCP Fast Open
#
# Linux:
# Both server and client-side TFO support must be enabled in the
# kernel, 'sudo sh -c "echo 3 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_fastopen"'.
#
# A packet capture on the loopback interface will show the TFO
# option on the SYN, but the fast-output SMTP banner will not
# be seen unless you also deliberately emulate a long path:
# 'sudo tc qdisc add dev lo root netem delay 100ms'
# You'll need kernel-modules-extra installed, or you get
# an unhelpful error from RTNETLINK.
# To tidy up:  'sudo tc qdisc delete dev lo root'
#
# First time runs will see a TFO request option only; subsequent
# ones should see the TFO cookie and fast-output SMTP banner
# (currently on a separate packet after the server SYN,ACK but before
# the client ACK).
#
# The client log => lint.ex  should have a "TFO" element.
# Assuming this is the first run since boot, the a@test recipient will not.
#
# The server log <= line for b@test.ex  should have a "TFO" element, but
# this will only be obtained when the above delay is inserted into the
# loopback net path.
#
# this attempt to tidy up does not work
#sudo perl
#open (my $fh, "/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_fastopen_key");
#print $fh "00000000-00000000-00000000-00000000";
#close $fh;
