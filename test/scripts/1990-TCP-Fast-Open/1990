# TCP Fast Open
#
# Linux:
# Both server and client-side TFO support must be enabled in the
# kernel, 'sudo sh -c "echo 3 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_fastopen"'.
#
# A packet capture on the loopback interface will show the TFO
# option on the SYN, but the fast-output SMTP banner will not
# be seen unless you also deliberately emulate a long path:
# 'sudo tc qdisc add dev lo root netem delay 100ms'
#
# First time runs will see a TFO request option only; subsequent
# ones should see the TFO cookie and fast-output SMTP banner
# (currently on a separate packet after the server SYN,ACK but before
# the client ACK).
#
# The log <= line should have a "TFO" element.
#
# If the client-side is disabled in the kernel, Exim logs
# will become noisy.
#
#
# FreeBSD: it looks like you have to compile a custom kernel, with
# 'options TCP_RFC7413' in the config.  Also set
# 'net.inet.tcp.fastopen.enabled=1' in /etc/sysctl.conf
# Untested.
